An R-tree implementation in OCaml

This library implements a simple R-tree library according to Guttman's
original paper. Currently node splitting is done through the quadratic
algorithm in that paper.

The interface (and implementation) is purely functional.

A functor interface is also provided for providing implicit bounds for
values.

See the files INSTALL.txt for building and installation instructions.
