Synopsis:    An R-tree implementation in OCaml
BuildTools:  ocamlbuild
Description:
  This library implements a simple R-tree library according to
  Guttman's original paper. Currently node splitting is done through
  the quadratic algorithm in that paper.
  .
  The interface (and implementation) is purely functional.
  .
  A functor interface is also provided for providing implicit bounds
  for values.
